          <p class="mech">
            I am a Mechanical Engineering Degree holder, always wanted to build
            a car on my own and I did that in my final year project with my
            teammates. I use to be a chubby guy throughout my childhood and
            later in my teenage and when I entered in the college I decided to
            change it and that’s how my fitness journey started. And I don’t
            remember when this fitness regime converted in to a passion which
            ultimately ended me winning a state level bodybuilding competition.
            Here my second big task completed. Now what???. I have heard
            BLOCKCHAIN but never got motivation to learn it. Now this is the
            time to learn it and add value to people’s life. Nobody I repeat
            Nobody can ever master BLOCKCHAIN so how can I ? but can update
            oneself , and that’s exactly I am doing……

          <p class="hero">
            As a blockchain consultant I researches, analyzes, develops, and
            tests blockchain technologies. This includes the documentation and
            maintenance of solutions, as well as their architectural integration
            with business logic. My goal is to translate business goals into
            technology roadmaps that clients can follow to achieve target
            outcomes. What makes me a valuable asset is my ability to combine
            both business and technical skills so that clients are able to
            create custom-build protocols and applications focused on the
            particular data optimization potential of their business. Among a
            variety of specific tasks, I will be responsible for assuring
            compliance with the appropriate regulatory and legal landscape.

            As Blockchain developers I have a strong mix of skills in the areas
            of computer networking, cryptography, and algorithms and data
            structures. And have expertise in smart contract on Ethereum
            Blockchain and building Dapps specially Defi apps. Financial domain
            has always been my strength and the traditional centralized
            financial system has lived its life and the future belongs to
            decentralized FINTECH. I have strong belief that this decade is the
            transitional phase and early adopters will be benefited
            exponentially. .
